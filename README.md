Now that you’ve seen how we can build out a Hello World React application I want you to do this alone from scratch. You can reference your previous HTML document, but I don’t want you copying and pasting the whole thing. Things you can copy and paste would be the script tags you need with the react library being pulled in via unpkg.

Steps to complete this assignment

create and index.html file
scaffold out a regular html page and add a <div> with an id of “target” or “app” or something that makes sense to you in terms            of distinguishing the div as the container for your application to live.
  
pull in the React and ReactDOM packages via CDN/UNPKG
create a script tag and add the attribute ‘type = “text/javascript”’ so that you can write your react application inline
inside your script tag, create your myElement variable and set it equal to the React.createElement() function.

Decide what type of element you want rendered to the screen, and what attributes (should have at least 1 className) you want on your element and what children text you’d like your element to display. Pass multiple strings to as children and see what happens.

finally, mount your element to your wrapper div using ReactDOM.render.

** Stretch Problem ** If you’re done early, create a <style></style> tag in your HTML document and select your className class and try changing the color of your element.
